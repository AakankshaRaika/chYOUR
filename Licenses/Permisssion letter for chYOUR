I Aakanksha Raika here by give the team chYOUR to use the ONLY following from my original idea : 

-Log in/ log out with only the application chyour itself and NOT the permission to do anything with the idea of syncing google or outlook. 
-Task list - To only be able to add a task with the cateory,Location and start time and end time fields. Be able to edit the task from 
 the list and delete the task manually NOT AUTOMATICALLY from the list.  
-To use the delete account feature. 
-To use the a map by connecting the chYOUR to google maps and pasring the location or category from the user input and use that as an input
 for the map.
