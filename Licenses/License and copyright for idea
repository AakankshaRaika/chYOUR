The idea for application which will be slowly developed in Android, iOS,
web application and any other platform we can think of below weather 
impletemented int his repository or another is a sole copyright and owned  
by Aakanksha Raika. A Person can not use this idea what so ever unless 
Aakanksha Raika gives them a writen permission to do so by expliciting the 
permission of using the idea along with any conditions Aakanksha Raika might have.
In that permission document she will also have to specify which parts of 
the idea she is allowing to be used. 

Idea originally consisted of the following and will be implemented as a whole 
ONLU by Aakankhsha Raika , Thomas Nunno and Todd Mitchell as a team under a
repository Aakanksha Raika will make under her own github: 

- Log in, log out and sign up: 
    a) With the application directly. 
    b) With google. 
    c) With outlook.
 
- Verify the account by confirming it through the email you used

- Add task list the application either by directly adding it with
  a mechanism in the application or by syncing their google or 
  outlook or the phone calendars to the application. This way
  they will only have to open one app. 

-Range: Range is a feature that allows a person to set a range of
 detour from anywhere between 0-10/15 miles. This will be used in
 the map functionality. The main purpose of the range function is
 to add a detour to the user’s route within the range that will
 help him or her reduce the size of the to-do list for the day or
 within their start-end time.

-Map: Map will either be implemented using google APIs or connecting 
 google maps to the app. This map will be used to detect is the user 
 is on the go. If he or she is then we will use range to add detours. 

-Notification: This functionally will be used to notify the user about
 an upcoming item in the to-do list , ending item in the to-do list or
 if the location they desire is in their set range. They will also be 
 notified before we add a detour on their route.there also will be notification
 for if people add you to a group, you join a group . someone in your group leaves, 
 or if you leave a group. 

-Delete Account: This will simply make the account settings the lists 
and any other information the fed the application to disappear from the 
application’s record/servers.

-Shared Lists: This functionality will enable the users to make groups 
within the application and maintain 2 lists personal and shared. The 
shared one will be uniform across the group, although only the person
near a “desired location” will be notified not all of them. They all 
will be able to add and mark of to-do items and keep track of everything 
much more efficiently. 

-Chat room: This functionally will enable to the groups to be able to make 
conversations. There will also be functionality like @username. If a user
uses that in the chat only the @ user will be notified not all the members.
This is so that not everyone is pinged at all hours. The application might
consist of personal chats.  If within a group chat a user uses @addTask and 
writes something in front of it the application will add that to the list
automatically.

-Location:  A user can either give us a location and/or select from the category. 

-Category: 
     a)Grocery 
     b)Pharmacy
  c)Hardware
  d)Other: for other a user will have to give the application a location input.  

-Edit tasks: A user can edit an existing task through this. 

-Delete Tasks: A user can either delete the task before they completed it or after.
Its completely their choice. The application will delete the task by itself once its
past end time. 

-Start and end time: a functionality to keep track of the time span a task needs to 
 be completed in. 

-Calendar: A user can either sync their google/outlook/phone calendar to the 
 application and access it from there along with adding more tasks to the 
 calendar through the application itself or they can chose to ask the application 
 to create an internal calendar for them which will only consist of the tasks
 they add to the application.

-Add group and group: A user can add as many as groups they want to add to their account. 
 The max size for a group will be 20 people. You can also assign a task within
 a group to specific people by using @username. Which will add the task to not
 only to the group list but also to that users personal list.

-Leave group: A user can access the leave group functionality which will basically 
 displaay a list of all the groups they are in and they can select all the groups 
 they wish to leave and leave them all with one click.

-Settings: Application settings will have but will not be limited to -> sign out/ log out,
manage account , delete account , add group , leave group , sign in with google/outlook , 
add calendar, Make calendar,Notification settings.
