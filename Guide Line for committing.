Reminder for all do not commit to master directly from sprint 2 : 
Steps for commiting this : 
1) your own personal branch. 
2) your team branch 
3) development branch for all 10 of us 
4) testing branch for all 10 of us
5) master. 

Code directly pushed into master without proper testing on each level will be 
deleted as it might (not always but might) break other things.
