Notes:  |
  Discussed project idea and plan with Ruhan, advised that project mock-up is not adequate for sprint 1, we need base code with GUI.
  Ruhan advised us that though we are split into two sub-groups, each team member should be prepared to discuss coding progress at each meeting, non-coding tasks are not considered progress.
  Team B (Login/Signup/Backend) is meeting Saturday at 8am to complete GUI for Login/Signup pages of app.
  Team A (tasks/settings/features) will be meeting later on Saturday to commence work on task page and settings GUI, will coordinate video recording in Capen video capture room.
  Ruhan consulted on pushing base code to existing repo, best option was to clone repo, paste project folder, add/commit/push, then clone in android studio.
