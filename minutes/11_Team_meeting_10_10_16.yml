Notes:  |
  Set primary goals for the sprint, we need to get the app functioning and underlying code connected to the GUI, and polish the GUI.  Yoseph and Vivian are being moved to Team B and Brian will move to team A as team A feels they do not have enough tasks remaining for 5 team members.  We will pool our resources to compile a master list of tasks remaining to evenly prioritize and assign tasks amongst the group.
