Notes:  |
  General meeting to get everyone up to speed with eachother and plan out the race to the end of sprint 3 on monday.  Per Slack, it seems that SSL certs have been ordered by Jesse for each of the servers so we will hold on any further SSL implementation / research for now until things are clearer.  We must focus on completing the sign up / sign in functions from app side to back end.
