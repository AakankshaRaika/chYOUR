Notes:  |
  Discussed splitting of team and tasks with Ruhan in a broad sense.  Front end group will be responsible for the 
  primary app functions including creation / management of tasks, google map integration, google and outlook calendar 
  sync, settings, etc.  Front end will take more of a full team approach, splitting methods amongst its memebers.  
  Back end team will be responsible for server creation and setup, framework selection, database creation and management, 
  and securing credential checking and creation.  Jason and Andrea will begin looking into the database, Alec will 
  research server hosting options, and Ash will research REST API and connecting the app to the DB.  Teams will meet
  again later in the week to discuss findings and decide on details and splitting moving forward.
