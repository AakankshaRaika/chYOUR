Notes:  |
  Ruhan advised we create basic php for query to get data from DB - temporary to demonstrate get function (query if a user exist or return list of all users, though our current php code does dempnstrate the function properly. We have been able to send args via http and insert / query data from the database successully.  Advised we must have a functioning projec to receive credit for the associated parts of sprint 3.
