Notes:  |
  Team meeting later in the day after TA meeting.  Server information and connection discussed amongst both teams. As most features have been implemented on the front end, it was proposed to move 2 - 3 members from team A to team B as front end is running out of things to do.  Team B will have another sub meeting on Saturday to coordinate Server - PHP - MySQL layout and access.
