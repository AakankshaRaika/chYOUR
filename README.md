Description:
chYOUR  is now  available on Android Google Play. This a GPS based application that will serve a purpose to remind users about important daily products that they would like to purchase in nearby department stores. It will also remind users about doctors appointments, meetings, and other work life essentials in order to make "bachelor" life manageable. Our target audience is college students, working families, employees, college alumni, and anyone who tends to forget a small reminder that can be available whenever they are on the go. The broader use that chYOUR will have (with collaboration with Google Calendar and built in phone calender) is a user will be notified by a male or female voice of an item they would like to purchase at a nearby department store, a meeting (30 minutes prior) that might have slipped their mind, or even an item they forgot on their reminder list as they walk past a nearby store that may carry that item.
